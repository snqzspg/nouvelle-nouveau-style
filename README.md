## Nouvelle/Nouveau Style Chrome Extension
**Note**: This is currently in Alpha Experimental phase.

This is a chrome extension source code that displayes [nouvelle-nouveau](https://nouvelle-nouveau.tumblr.com/) and [bruitdefond-blog](https://bruitdefond-blog.tumblr.com/) in the former style that they used to be.

## Where are the posts?
On 10th of February 2021, [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/) released a four-episode documentary named [Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel](https://www.netflix.com/title/81183727) which features the mysterous death of the blogs' owner, Elisa Lam, the various conspiracies and the final conclusion of how she passed away. Her [nouvelle-nouveau](https://nouvelle-nouveau.tumblr.com/) blog has been heavily referenced throughout the series. However, when one views the blog's homepage, they will be greeted by the blog title, epigraph and some basic Tumblr navigations, followed by a blank content. Even though the homepage is blank, the posts are not removed (touch wood!), instead they are not shown due to missing scripts that are used by the theme of her blog to display posts. When one clicks on the [archive page of her blog](https://nouvelle-nouveau.tumblr.com/archive), he/she can see the contents of the blog.
